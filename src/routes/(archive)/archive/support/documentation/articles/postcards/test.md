As part of the MiddChallenge Grant we will be providing weekly updates throughout the summer to share the progress of our developments on various efforts at Fourth Dot, with a particular focus on the development of our note taking application NoteBook. The first full week of June has been a busy one. Here is everything we have been working on.

## Branding

Fourth Dot's brand is focused on simple and easy to understand graphics, punchy images, and clear typography. One element of the brand previously remained unresolved, until this week. The "Inter" typeface was selected to replace our existing typeface across all documents and our website. This new face offers increased legability across a variation of weights. Furthermore the typeface closely aligns with the system font on macOS, iOS, and iPadOS which will increase continuity between our products user interface and our brand.
