As part of the MiddChallenge Grant we will be providing weekly updates throughout the summer to share the progress of our developments on various efforts at Fourth Dot, with a particular focus on the development of our note taking application NoteBook. The first full week of June has been a busy one. Here is everything we have been working on.

## Branding

Fourth Dot's brand is focused on simple and easy to understand graphics, punchy images, and clear typography. One element of the brand previously remained unresolved, until this week. The "Inter" typeface was selected to replace our existing typeface across all documents and our website. This new face offers increased legability across a variation of weights. Furthermore the typeface closely aligns with the system font on macOS, iOS, and iPadOS which will increase continuity between our products user interface and our brand.

## Website Redesign

The original website for Fourth Dot featured a large grey navigation bar with quite a few links. This increased the complexity of navigating the website and ultimately added unnecessary complexity to the design. With this in mind the website's main navigation was revised to feature the word mark, three links, and a search field. This simpfies navigation and places great emphasis on our products.

The footer of the website was also updated. Items were rearranged and categories were condensed to create a simpler layout. Three variations of the footer were also created: one in white, one in light grey, and one in slate. These additional color variations aid in the deferentiation of the footer from other page content.

## Research

This week also coincides with Apple's annual developer conference WWDC. The conference includes prerecorded video presentations, interactive labs, and projects showing the latest advancements available to developers. The keynote address on Monday provided an overview of the new versions of all Apple's operating systems. The in-depth developer sessions provide API level insight into changes in Swift, SwiftUI, and various system frameworks used to develop for Apple's platforms.Additionally this week also marked the first week with access to the library of objc.io. This provided to be a really helpful resource already as some of the tutorials and code samples have aided in the devlopement of NoteBook's layout system.
